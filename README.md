Regression Assignment: California Housing Dataset

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of various regression algorithms on the California Housing dataset. The objective is to predict the median house value based on several features such as location, income, and house age. The assignment covers data preprocessing, implementation of regression algorithms, and performance evaluation.

Key Components:
Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded using fetch_california_housing from sklearn.

Converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.

Handled missing values (if any) and performed feature scaling (standardization) to normalize the data.

Explained and justified the preprocessing steps to ensure the dataset is ready for modeling.

Regression Algorithm Implementation:

Implemented the following regression algorithms:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

For each algorithm:

Provided a brief explanation of how it works.

Explained why it might be suitable for this dataset.

Model Evaluation and Comparison:

Evaluated the performance of each algorithm using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R-squared Score (RÂ²)

Compared the results of all models to identify:

The best-performing algorithm with justification.

The worst-performing algorithm with reasoning.

Timely Submission:

The code is submitted in a Jupyter Notebook format.

The code is well-documented with clear and concise explanations.
